Doing this is useful when different application teams in your organization are allocated separate resource groups and need to manage their own backups and restores. You can optionally exclude virtual machines containing a specified tag to control the scope of assignment. See https://aka.ms/AzureVMAppCentricBackupIncludeTag.",
