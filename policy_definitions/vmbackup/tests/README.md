# Tests VM Backup Policies

This folder contains tests for the enterprise scale VM backup policy.

Tests are following the four phase model *Setup*, *Exercise*, *Verify*, *Cleanup*. A test may be manual, automated or a mix of both. In any case the `README.md` in each test folder contains a textual description of any phase and a general overview, what the test verifies.
